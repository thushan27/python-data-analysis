# python-data-analysis
Notes and exercises from Intermediate Python course at Goldsmith's, University of London. The course covered how to import csv/excel files using Python, as well importing data from the web from sites like Wikipedia. We then proceeded to filter and clean the data, as well as apply basic statistics to understand the data.
