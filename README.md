# python-data-analysis
Notes and exercises from Python for Data Analysis course at Goldsmith's, University of London. The course involved using the Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib packages, covered how to import csv/excel files using Python, as well importing data from sites like Wikipedia. We then proceeded to filter and clean the data, as well as apply basic statistics to understand the data.
